# MicroBitSecurity

##	Executive Summary

**CYBR 8080 Project Milestone 2 - Nov 19, 2019 - Bob Wilmes**

During this phase of the project, I am utilizing some Bluetooth libraries from Android by Mr. Martin Wooley, Bluetooth SIG rep for the UK

https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-blue

I developed embedded C++ code for the MicroBit ARM processor which uses the yotta build chain and the GNU C++ compiler on Linux.
This code is found in the embedded subdirectory.
I am able to pair the MicroBit with the Android phone.

My main issues are the complex debugging environment for the embedded device to the Android.

## Summary

By demonstrating the use of a pattern of LED's on the Micro Bit device, this technique could be expanded for other uses of cues for visual authentication. For example, the camera on the Pixel 3 mobile phone could be programmed to read the pattern of LED's, thereby removing potential errors in the process of capturing the on/off status on the Android application. This would potentially be a novel way for IoT devices to securely authenticate if they lacked keyboards or other sensory inputs.
